# DIGITAL-LOGIC-DESIGN. 

This project is a Home Automation System developed as part of a Digital Logic Design (DLD) course. The system automates basic household functionalities such as controlling lights and fans using logic gates and digital circuits.

ðŸ”§ Key Features:
Control of home appliances (e.g., lights, fans) through digital input

Implementation using basic logic gates and combinational logic

Simulation done in software like Logisim / Proteus / Multisim (specify your tool)

Focused on practical application of Boolean algebra, truth tables, and circuit minimization

ðŸ“š Technologies Used:
Digital Logic Gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR)

Circuit simulation tools (mention your simulator)

Basic electronics components

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives:
Apply digital logic design principles in a real-world scenario

Build an interactive and functional automation system prototype

Reinforce learning of circuit design, simplification, and simulation
